# Changing the container only (works only if the output supports the codecs of the input)
# It is quicker
ffmpeg -i input.mkv -vcodec copy -acodec copy output.mp4

# If the output does not support the codecs of the input, use the following (it takes longer coz ffmpeg has to encode the entire file):
ffmpeg -i input.mkv output.mp4
